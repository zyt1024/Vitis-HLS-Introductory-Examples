## C/C++ synthesizable examples

Each includes code sources for top function and testbench, a README, Tcl files.  They are organized in categories denoted by the prefix of the directory in which they reside:
* Dataflow: Common examples that illustrate usage of different channels and topologies
* Pipelining: Common examples that illustrate pipeline pragma usage for loops and functions
* Interface: Common examples that illustrate the usage of the various modes and interface protocols
* Modeling: Math and DSP examples and other common use models/algorithms
* Misc: Other examples such as RTL blackbox in C++

## Running the examples
A Tcl file is provided:
* _run_hls.tcl_: Sets up the project and specifies what steps of the flow will be executed (by default only C simulation and C synthesis are run).  
  By changing the value of hls_exec it's possible to run C-RTL co-simulation and Vivado implementation

To run at the command line, navigate to the example directory, type:
`vitis_hls -f run_hls.tcl`

To load the design into the HLS GUI, "Open"->"Project file" and select the project directory
